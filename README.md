# Modern Software Engineer

I am the very model of a modern Software Engineer  
I code in Java, Scala, Python, Rust and TypeScript to be clear  
I know frameworks like Spring Boot, ZIO, Play and on the front React  
With Hibernate and Slick, and Quill no data base stops me in fact  

My mathematical background gives me many advantages  
Logic, statistics, category theory and other fields  
I understand, concepts such like morphisms, functors and monoids  
And that one famous definition what a monad really is  

And that one famous definition what a monad really is  
And that one famous definition what a monad really is  
And that one famous definition what a monad really f@$%ing is  

I understand both paradigms functional and imperative  
But if you don’t use functional, in my eyes you’re a heretic  
In short in matters of the code and mathematics, mentioned here  
I am the very model of a modern Software Engineer  

In short in matters of the code and mathematics, mentioned here  
He is the very model of a modern Software Engineer
